2. Go To the Application directory in this repository and download the files. Right afterward copy Server_Web to the webapp directory where your tomcat is located
(for Example, copy Server_Web to the next Directory: D:\Downloads\apache-tomcat-10.0.22\webapps
3. To Open an admin app or customer app simply double click either AdminApp.bat or CustomerApp.bat in their own directory

How the application works?
At the Application directory in this repository, go to the ABS README 3. there exists an explenation at hebrew, which i will translate to english and update in this

Application directory.
