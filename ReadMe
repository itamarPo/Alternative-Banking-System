Alternative banking system. A project in JAVA made by Itamar Podolsky and Itay levy on

In this project we created an alternative way to make a loans, (alternative from the banks). an application like Social lender, blender, Prosper and so on.

How to start:
1. Please make sure you have java installed in your computer and that your PATH is defined. 
We used tomcat servers for this project, so please make sure you also have that.
2. Go To the Application directory in this repository and download the files. Right afterward copy Server_Web to the webapp directory where your tomcat is located
(for Example, copy Server_Web to the next Directory: D:\Downloads\apache-tomcat-10.0.22\webapps
3. To Open an admin app or client app simply double click either AdminApp.bat or ClientApp.bat in their own directory

How the application works?
At the Application directory in this repository, go to the ABS README 3. there exists an explenation at hebrew, which i will translate to english and update in this
ReadMe at a later date.

Application directory.
