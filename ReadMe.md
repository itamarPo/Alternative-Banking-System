Alternative banking system. A project in JAVA made by Itamar Podolsky and Itay levy on

In this project we created an alternative way to make a loans, (alternative from the banks). an application like Social lender, blender, Prosper and so on.

How to start:
1. Please make sure you have java installed in your computer and that your PATH is defined. 
2. Download and extract apache-tomcat-10.0.22.zip from Application Directory (if you already have apache-tomcat simply copy Server_Web.war to the webapps directory)
3. In cmd go to the location of your extracted apache-tomcat -> bin -> and type : startup.bat (that will open up your server)
4. To Open an admin app or customer app go to Application directory, and then simply double click either AdminApp.bat or CustomerApp.bat in their own directory

How the application works?
At the Application directory in this repository, go to the ABS README 3. there exists an explenation at hebrew, which i will translate to english and update in this
ReadMe at a later date.

Please Note, you cant make your own category. In order to have categories to create a loan you have to load an existing category using the example XML files in the 
Application directory.
